Find <a href="TLPH_website_tables_6-6.pdf" target="_blank">here</a> the **exact numerical results of the strength of each relationship**, the conditional set of variables that resulted in the minimum partial distance correlation between any two variables, and the _p_-value of the conditional independence test.

If you are looking to conduct research with these results, we have also made the strength of each relationship available as a <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/felix-laumann/SDG-networks/gh-pages/Results/csv/conditions_Africa.csv" target="_blank" download>csv file</a> _(right-click > Save Link As...)_.
